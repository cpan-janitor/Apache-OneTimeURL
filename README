Apache::OneTimeURL

This module is designed to provide a one-time URL for retrieval of a
resource via HTTP. The module requires an Apache webserver with mod_perl
enabled and with appropriate configuration directives.

When a URL is generated it will only be viewable once, and will then
return an error. For the first five times that the URL is accessed in
error, a mail will be sent to the email address given in the config. The
number of times can be configured with the OneTimeMailCount variable.
