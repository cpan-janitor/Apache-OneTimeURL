=head1 NAME

Apache::OneTimeURL - One-time use URLs for sensitive data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    PerlModule Apache::OneTimeURL
    <Location /secret>
        PerlHandle Apache:OneTimeURL
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlSetVar OneTimeDb  /opt/secret/access.db
        PerlSetVar OneTimeDoc /opt/secret/realfile.html
        PerlSetVar OneTimeEmail intruder@simon-cozens.org
    </Location>

F<authorize.pl>:
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use Apache::OneTimeURL;
    my $comments = join " ", @ARGV;
    my $db = "/opt/secret/access.db";
    print "http://www.my.server.int/secret/",
           Apache::OneTimeURL->authorize($db, $comments),
           "\n";

Now:

    % authorize.pl Given to Simon C on IRC
    http://www.my.server.int/secret/2c61de78edd612cf79c0d73a3c7c94fb

This URL will only be viewable once, and will then return an error. For
the first five times that the URL is accessed in error, a mail will be sent
to the email address given in the config. The number of times can be
configured with the C<OneTimeMailCount> variable; if you don't want any
mail, set this to zero.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The synopsis pretty much wraps it up. I'm paranoid about giving out
certain information, and although I can't really control what people do
with the HTML when they download it, I can damned well ensure that URLs
in mail I send don't end up on the web and being a liability. Hence the
desire for a URL that's only valid once. You may have your own
interesting uses for such a set-up.

I've hopefully designed the module so that if there's some aspect of its
behaviour you don't like, you can switch to the "method handler" style
(ie. C<PerlHandler Apache::OneTime::URL-E<gt>handler> and subclass to
override the bits you're unhappy about. This may be easier than convincing
me to make changes to the module.
